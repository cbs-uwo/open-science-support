# Open Science Support

This repository is a home for any support requests Western neuroscience researchers might have related to Open Science. Tristan Kuehn, Open Science Software Developer, is the primary maintainer of this repository, and will mange those requests.

I'm available to help with:

- Designing a study for pre-registration
- Preparing data to share
- Preparing code to share
- Identifying an appropriate repository for submitting pre-registrations, data, and/or code.

My goal is to make it easy for neuroscience researchers at Western to benefit from Open Science.

## Procedure

If you have a project you'd like me to help with, please submit an issue under the issues tab with a brief description of what kind of help you're looking for, following the issue template.

The issues in this repository are public, so if you'd prefer not to make your request public for any reason, you can send me an email at my Western email address instead.

## Wiki

Some Western staff are working on a knowledge base/wiki/forum to act as a home for resources related to Open Science. Until that's ready, feel free to use the wiki here as a general source of Open Science resources.
